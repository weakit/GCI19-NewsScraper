# News Scraper

A simple news scraper in python.

Finds articles of interest from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/ "News API"), renders html with the articles, and then opens them in your browser.

You need to set `API_KEY` in `newslist.py` for the script to work. Get one from [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org/ "News API"). \
While you're doing that, feel free to edit the keywords to get articles specific to your interests.
